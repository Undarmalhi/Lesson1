<p>The purpose of a web browser is
to read HTML documents and compose them into visible
or audible web pages. The browser does not display
the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the
content of the page. HTML describes the structure
of a website semantically along with cues for
presentation, making it a markup language rather
than a programming language. </p>

Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text
and other material. The W3C, maintainer of both
the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the
use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML.</p>
